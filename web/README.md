# UTS UI Prototype v3 (React + Vite)

## New UI Upgrades
- LP Deployment panel:
  - Deploy to Netlify (one‑click UI)
  - Push to GitHub repository (UI)
  - Export LP as HTML ZIP
- Added inside LP Detail page for per‑LP control.

All actions are UI demo only. Backend will wire:
- Netlify OAuth + build hooks
- GitHub OAuth + repo commits
- HTML export ZIP generation
